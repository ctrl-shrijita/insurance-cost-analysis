# 🏥 Insurance Charges Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts **medical insurance charges** based on factors like age, BMI, smoking habits, gender, and region.  
The goal is to apply **data science techniques** — from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to **machine learning models** — and evaluate how well these models can predict healthcare costs.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: Medical Insurance Dataset (commonly used for regression tasks)
- **Features**:
  - `age` – Age of the insured individual
  - `sex` – Gender
  - `bmi` – Body Mass Index
  - `children` – Number of dependents covered
  - `smoker` – Whether the person is a smoker
  - `region` – Residential area
  - `charges` – Insurance cost (target variable)

---

## 🔍 Key Steps
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature Engineering (encoding categorical variables, scaling)
- Regression Models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge/Lasso Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
- Model Evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R² Score)

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning models & evaluation
- **Jupyter Notebook** – analysis environment

## 📊 Visualizations
The notebook includes:
- Distribution of insurance charges
- Impact of smoking on charges
- Correlation heatmap of features
- Model performance comparison
